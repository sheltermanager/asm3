Appendix: CSV file import fields
================================

ASM will recognise columns with the following names when importing CSV files.
Where you wish to supply multiple rows for the same animal (such as for
vaccinations or regimens), make sure you have a populated ANIMALCODE column,
similarly for multiple rows to people (such as movements, licenses, etc) make
sure you have populated person data.

When processing animal records that already exist, there are certain key fields
that will be overwritten on the existing animal from the CSV data if those columns
exist in the CSV data and have a value for that row. 

These fields are:

* ANIMALCOMMENTS / ANIMALDESCRIPTION / ANIMALWARNING
* ANIMALDECEASEDDATE
* ANIMALDECEASEDNOTES
* ANIMALDECEASEDREASON
* ANIMALDOB
* ANIMALEUTHANIZED
* ANIMALFLAGS
* ANIMALHEALTHPROBLEMS. 
* ANIMALLOCATION / ANIMALUNIT
* ANIMALMICROCHIP / ANIMALMICROCHIPDATE
* ANIMALNEUTERED / ANIMALNEUTEREDDATE
* ANIMALPICKUPADDRESS
* ANIMALPICKUPLOCATION

This allows you to use a spreadsheet of data to update many animals on chipping/neutering
days (for example), or update many animal bios in one go.

When importing incident data from CSV files, the person fields supplied will be used as
the caller.
