Payment Processors
==================

ASM can request due payments from customers via a payment processor. Currently,
support is available for PayPal, Stripe and Cardcom (Israel only).

For details on configuring payment processors from the options screen at
:menuselection:`Settings --> Options --> Payment Processors`, see
:ref:`paymentprocessors`

Requesting a payment
--------------------

To request a payment from a customer, first create that payment in either the
payment tab for a person or animal, or :menuselection:`Financial --> Payment Book`

Your payment should have a due date, but no received date.

Next, request payment from the customer by selecting your payment from the list
and clicking "Request Payment" followed by the processor you would like to use
to receive the payment.

.. image:: images/processor_2_paypal.png

The screen will pop up an email dialog, allowing you to complete details of the
message to be sent requesting the payment. Use document templates to store
commonly used emails and populate the text by choosing them from the Template
dropdown at the bottom of the dialog.

The payment request link will be appended to the bottom of your message after
you hit Send.

.. warning:: The subject line of your request email will be used as the description of the item presented to the customer when they pay.

.. image:: images/processor_3_email.png

The resulting email will end up in the customer's inbox with a clickable
link to pay with the payment processor.

Note the payment references that ASM uses are in the form of
PERSON-RECEIPTNUMBER to prevent one person receiving a payment request from
changing or guessing another receipt number to try and access another
customer's payment.

The subject line of your email will be used as the payment description at the
checkout. ASM will default the comments from the selected payment and if they
are not present, will suggest the payment type.

Once payment has been completed, the system will automatically update the
received date on the payment record. If you have the option on to create
matching accounting transactions for received payments, a transaction
will be written at this point. If you have configured an expense account
for transaction fees, a transaction will be written to deduct the fee and
send it to the expense account.

Requesting fulfilment of multiple payments
------------------------------------------

Payment requests are linked to receipt numbers rather than individual payments.

While most payments will have their own receipt numbers, it is also possible to
create multiple due payments on the same receipt number by using the
:menuselection:`Financial --> Receive a payment` or :menuselection:`Move -->
Adopt an animal` screens.

For these screens to allow you to set the due date, you need to have set the
option :menuselection:`Settings --> Options --> Accounts --> When receiving
multiple payments, allow the due and received dates to be set`

When choosing a due payment from the Payment Book or a payment tab, the other
payments with the same receipt number will also be included and added to the
payment total requested. 

Adoption checkout
----------------------

The adoption checkout feature allows an adopter to complete the adoption process
on their mobile device. It allows them to view and sign their adoption paperwork,
make an optional donation and then sends them off to your chosen payment processor
to pay the adoption fee and donation.

To enable the feature, it must first be configured under 
:menuselection:`Settings --> Options --> Checkout`

.. image:: images/adoption_checkout_config.png

The configuration options allow you to choose the payment processor you want to 
handle the payments, the document template you want to use to create the adoption
paperwork, the payment method to use when creating payments and the payment types 
to use when recording the adoption fee and donation.

Initiating
^^^^^^^^^^

.. image:: images/adoption_checkout_start.png

Checkout is initiated from the movement tab of the person or animal (or the
reservation or "recently adopted" books). It can be done from either a
reservation or adoption movement, although if you do use a reservation you will
need to manually convert it to an adoption afterwards. 

Select the movement and click the "Adopter checkout" button on the toolbar. 

If you have not configured the feature, this button will not appear.

.. image:: images/adoption_checkout_sendemail.png

The button will prompt you to send an email to the adopter. Relevant information will
be pre-filled and as with other email dialogs, you can use a document template or
write ad-hoc content.

A link will be added below your email message that links to the checkout system.

Checkout Link
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The adopter follows the link in the email on their mobile device (tablets and desktops
can also be used, it is not limited in any way to just mobiles).

At this point the system creates the adoption paperwork on the animal and person
record ready for the adopter to view and sign on their device.

.. image:: images/adoption_checkout_1.png

The checkout will remind the adopter which animal they are adopting and the adoption
fee. This value is taken from the adoption fee field on the animal's record.

.. image:: images/adoption_checkout_2.png

They will then be prompted to view and sign their adoption paperwork. 

The adopter can also choose at this point to have a PDF of their signed
adoption paperwork emailed to them.

.. image:: images/adoption_checkout_3.png

The adopter will be asked if they would like to make a donation. The message
can be configured, as can all the suggested tiers of donation. 

.. warning:: If you remove the $0 donation tier from the list, the adopter will only be able to continue if they make a donation as they must choose one option.

When you are configuring the donation tiers, the system will show everything to
the left of the = sign in bold at the top of the button. This means that you
should include your currency symbol for readability as shown in the example
configuration above. You can also optionally include the decimal portion if you
feel it looks better - eg: $25 vs $25.00

Once the user has chosen their donation tier, the system will create due payment
records for the adoption fee and donation against the animal and person. It will
add their signature to the paperwork at this point and send an email containing
a PDF of the paperwork to the adopter if they requested it.

.. image:: images/adoption_checkout_4.png

Finally, the adopter will be redirected to the payment processor you have
configured to take their payment online. 

Depending on what apps are available on their device (eg: Google or Apple Pay)
and which payment processor you are using, this can be an extremely trivial
process that does not necessarily involve hand entering card numbers.

When payment is complete, the received date will be set on the two payment
records for the fee and donation and any accounting transactions created. The
adopter will be redirected to the success URL you configured under the payment
processor options.

Incomplete payments
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

If the adopter does not complete their payment at this point, the payment records
are left outstanding in the system.

If the adopter returns to the checkout by following the link again, or
navigating back from the payment processor, the paperwork will not be created
and signed again. The adopter can choose a new donation tier if they wish and
the system will update the due donation payment record to reflect the new value
that they've chosen. If they choose the 0 tier, the donation payment record
will be deleted.

No matter how many times the adopter returns to the checkout, once payment has
been made, the records will be updated. 

The system will maintain the checkout state for 48 hours before removing it.
After this period, the adopter will receive an error and will not be able to
use their checkout link until a member of staff initiates the adoption checkout
process again from the movement tab/book.
