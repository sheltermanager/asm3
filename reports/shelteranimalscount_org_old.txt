-- requires that you have a Surrender entry category for surrenders
-- requires that you have a Stray entry category for strays
-- requires that you have a TNR entry category to exclude TNR from Return To Field
-- has a extra sections for adoption returns and DOA that are not present on the SAC form
-- the CSV import version below adds adoption returns to surrender count, and omits DOA from intake instead
