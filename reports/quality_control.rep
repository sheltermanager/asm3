-- ******************************************** INSTRUCTIONS **********************************************************
-- 1.  Clone this report and change name to "Quality Control (Custom) (Version)". MAKE CHANGES TO CLONED VERSION ONLY!
-- 2.  Schedule to auto run in the morning BEFORE the start of the day and set an email to qc staff.
-- 3.  Go to Settings > Options > Display > and select 'Show ID numbers when editing lookup data' > Save
-- 4.  Edit each CONST below to meet your individual system needs.  
-- 5.  Add a Person Flag and Animal Flag of 'Ignore Issues'.  This is needed to override alerts on a case-by-case basis.
-- 6.  In Settings > Document templates, make sure all your Template names end with .html (this is the only way to separate online
--     forms and document templates for the 'Online form attached to existing Person record' issue at this point.
-- 7.  There are three sections:  ANIMAL, PEOPLE, LOCAL.  Add local SQLs to LOCAL Section to make updating easier when new versions come out.
-- 8.  If you receive the error "canceling statement due to statement timeout" you will need to pull the Possible duplicate person 
--     and Duplicate Phone SQLs out of this main program and add them to their own individual report.  Just too many records to process.
-- 9.  You can QC old data by copy, pasting, and editing individual SQLs in the SQL Interface.
