<h1>Options<a class="headerlink" href="#options" title="Permalink to this heading">¶</a></h1>
<p>The main <span class="menuselection">Settings ‣ Options</span> page allows configuring of the
general preferences within Animal Shelter Manager.</p>
<section id="shelter-details">
<h2>Shelter Details<a class="headerlink" href="#shelter-details" title="Permalink to this heading">¶</a></h2>
<p>The shelter details tab allows you to enter contact information for your
shelter. This is used with reporting and internet publishing.</p>
<p>The “Server Adjustment” box allows you to set a time offset in hours from the
server clock. This is only necessary if your client is in a different timezone
from the server. For example, the main sheltermanager.com servers are in the
UK. East coast Americans will want to adjust the time by -5 hours to make sure
alerts appear at the correct time and reports are shown correctly.</p>
</section>
<section id="accounts">
<h2>Accounts<a class="headerlink" href="#accounts" title="Permalink to this heading">¶</a></h2>
<p>ASM contains a full double entry accounting package. The options here are:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Enable Accounts Functionality: Unticking this box will cause ASM to remove
all accounts related menu entries/buttons so that users do not see it, and
you will not be using ASM to manage your accounts.</p></li>
<li><p>Creating payments and payments types creates matching accounts and
transactions: When you create a new payment type, or log a new payment
against an owner/animal, ASM will automatically create a matching account in
the accounts system if one does not exist, and a matching transaction.</p></li>
<li><p>Creating costs and cost types creates matching accounts and
transactions: When you create a new cost type, or log a new cost
against an animal, ASM will automatically create a matching account in
the accounts system if one does not exist, and a matching transaction.</p></li>
<li><p>When receiving payments, allow the deposit account to be overridden: When
adding payments to the system, if you have the create matching transactions
option on as well as this one, a destination account dropdown will be shown
on payment screens allowing you to override the deposit account that the
donation will be applied to (the withdrawal account is always the donation
type’s matching income account).</p></li>
<li><p>When receiving payments, allow a quantity and unit price to be set: When
adding payments to the system, allow a quantity and unit price to be included
for multiple item purchases/payments.</p></li>
<li><p>When receiving payments, allow a transaction fee to be set: Allows a
transaction fee to be recorded with the payment (eg: The cut taken by
services like PayPal, Amazon Payments, Google Wallet, Stripe, etc).</p></li>
<li><p>When receiving payments, allow recording of sales tax with a default rate of %:
ASM can calculate and store sales tax/VAT/GST amounts on payments you receive
for taxable goods. Enabling this option will add a tickbox to all payment
screens allowing you to calculate the taxable value (assumes your amount is
gross and inclusive of tax/VAT/GST).</p></li>
<li><p>When calculating sales tax, assume the payment amount is net and add it:
Not everyone charges for items that are inclusive of tax and don’t have the
full amount to hand. With this option on, when the system calculates the sales
tax/VAT/GST on your payment amount, it will calculate it as if the amount was
exclusive of tax and then add it to the amount so that it becomes a gross
amount, inclusive of tax. Eg: $50 at 20% will produce $10 tax and the amount
will become $60 with this option on. With it off, tax will be calculated
as $8.33 for $50.</p></li>
<li><p>When receiving multiple payments, allow the due and received dates to be set:
If this option is on, due and received date columns will be shown when taking
payments from the Move screens and Receive a Payment screen.</p></li>
<li><p>Only show account totals for the current period, which starts on: If you wish
to use accounting periods, put the start date in here. By enabling the show
account totals for current period option, the totals shown on the account
screen will only include transactions from this date or later.</p></li>
<li><p>Default transaction view: When viewing transactions for an account, ASM will
show transactions matching this time period. The default is the current
month.</p></li>
<li><p>Default source account for costs: When ASM creates a matching cost
transaction, it will use the cost type to find the expense account to use.
The source account here denotes where the money will be moved from. If you do
not set one, ASM will use the first bank account on file.</p></li>
<li><p>Default destination account for payments: When ASM creates a matching
payment transaction, it will use the payment type to find the income
account to use. The destination account here denotes where the money will be
moved to. If you do not set one, ASM will use the first bank account on file.</p></li>
<li><p>Income account for sales tax: If you are creating matching transactions from
payment records and there is a tax/VAT/GST value present, the system will
write a transaction to deposit the tax into the target bank account from the
income account you nominate here, giving you an easy way to track your
tax burden while keeping your bank balances correct.</p></li>
<li><p>Expense account for transaction fees: If you are creating matching
transactions from payment records and there is a fee present, the system will
write a transaction to deduct the fee from the target bank account and send
it to the expense account you nominate here.</p></li>
<li><p>Donations of type … are sent to …: In addition to the default payment
destination account, you can specify optional mappings, so that when ASM
receives a payment of a particular type, it uses the specified destination
account for it when creating the matching accounting transaction.</p></li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="add-animal">
<h2>Add Animal<a class="headerlink" href="#add-animal" title="Permalink to this heading">¶</a></h2>
<p>ASM allows you to bulk add more than one animal at a time by just hitting the
“Create” button on the new animal screen instead of “Create and Edit” - this is
useful if booking in a litter of kittens and puppies for example. Here, you can
choose some extra fields for the new animal screen.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Show breed field(s): Allow entry of a breed</p></li>
<li><p>Use a single breed field for animals: Setting this option will make ASM only
display a single breed field on the animal details screen. This is the norm
for UK shelters, where animals are either pedigree or a crossbreed (a
“Crossbreed” breed can be added to the lookup). Without this option set, ASM
allows for two breed fields and a crossbreed indicator so that mixed breed
type animals can be recorded (this is typical for US shelters).</p></li>
<li><p>Show the color field: Allow entry of a specific colour</p></li>
<li><p>Show the adoption fee field: Allow entry of an adoption fee</p></li>
<li><p>Show the internal location field: Allow entry of an internal location</p></li>
<li><p>Show the location unit field: Allow a cage/pen/kennel/hutch number to be set</p></li>
<li><p>Allow a fosterer to be selected: Allow new animals to be fostered straight
away</p></li>
<li><p>Allow an adoption coordinator to be selected: Allow assignment of an adoption
coordinator</p></li>
<li><p>Show the litter ID field: Allow a litter ID</p></li>
<li><p>Show the size field: Allow entry of the size</p></li>
<li><p>Show the weight field: Allow entry of the weight</p></li>
<li><p>Show the altered fields: Allow an altered date to be set</p></li>
<li><p>Show the microchip fields: Allow a microchip date/number to be set</p></li>
<li><p>Show the entry category field: Allow an entry category to be set</p></li>
<li><p>Show the original owner field: Allow original owner to be set</p></li>
<li><p>Show the pickup fields: Allow pickup location/address to be set</p></li>
<li><p>Show the brought in by field: Allow brought in by to be set</p></li>
<li><p>Show the transfer in field: Allow incoming transfers to be set</p></li>
<li><p>Show the hold fields: Allow hold and hold until date to be set</p></li>
<li><p>Warn if the animal is similar to one entered recently: Pop up a warning
dialog if the animal’s name is the same as one entered recently to help
prevent possible duplicates.</p></li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="age-groups">
<h2>Age Groups<a class="headerlink" href="#age-groups" title="Permalink to this heading">¶</a></h2>
<p>It is possible to categorise your animals by their age in ASM. This is useful
when generating adoption paperwork and you don’t have an exact date of birth
for the animal. Instead, ASM can specify one if its groups, using the AgeGroup
wordkey (or animal.AgeGroup field in custom reports).</p>
<p>This tab allows you to choose the threshold for each grouping, as well as the
grouping name. By default, anything under 6 months (0.5 years) is classed as a
Baby, anything under 2 years is Young Adult, under 7 years is Adult and over
that is Senior.</p>
</section>
<section id="animal-codes">
<h2>Animal Codes<a class="headerlink" href="#animal-codes" title="Permalink to this heading">¶</a></h2>
<p>ASM allows you to choose the format that animal codes will be automatically
generated in. ASM internally stores two codes for each animal, the “normal”
code, unique among all animals and the “short” code. The short code does not
have to be unique and is used by staff wanting to quickly identify animals in
conversation.</p>
<p>The defaults are TYYYYNNN (the first letter of the animal type, followed by the
year it was brought to the shelter, followed by a number unique within that
year for that type of animal) for the normal code and NNT for the shortcode (a
unique number within the year for the animal’s type, followed by the type).</p>
<p>You can build and use any format string you like, using the following tokens:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>YYYY - The year the animal was brought into the shelter (4 digits)</p></li>
<li><p>YY - The year the animal was brought into the shelter (2 digits)</p></li>
<li><p>MM - The month the animal was brought into the shelter</p></li>
<li><p>DD - The day the animal was brought into the shelter</p></li>
<li><p>E - The first letter of the animal’s entry category</p></li>
<li><p>EE - The first and second letters of the animal’s entry category</p></li>
<li><p>S - The first letter of the animal’s species</p></li>
<li><p>SS - The first and second letters of the animal’s species</p></li>
<li><p>T - The first letter of the animal’s type</p></li>
<li><p>TT – The first and second letters of the animal’s type</p></li>
<li><p>UUUUUUUUUU - (10 digits) a unique number representing the animal (this number
will never be used for another animal), padded to 10 digits. If the number
overflows, more digits will be used.</p></li>
<li><p>UUUU - (4 digits) a unique number representing the animal (this number will
never be used for another animal), padded to 4 digits. If the number
overflows, more digits will be used.</p></li>
<li><p>XXX - (3 digits) a number which is unique for all animals within the year</p></li>
<li><p>XX - A number which is unique for all animals within the year, no padding is
done.</p></li>
<li><p>NNN - (3 digits) a number representing the animal, which is unique within the
year brought in for the animal’s type and padded to 3 digits. If the number
overflows, more digits will be used.</p></li>
<li><p>NN - A number representing the animal, which is unique within the year
brought in for the animal’s type. No padding is done.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Here are some examples:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>YYYYMMDD-NNN-T (an ISO date, followed by a unique number/type within the
year). Eg: 20080520-001-D</p></li>
<li><p>TUUUUUUUUUU (the animal’s type, followed by a unique number for the animal) -
Eg: U0000003412</p></li>
</ul>
<p>If you change the coding formats when you already have animals on file using a
different format, those animals will be ignored when creating new codes and
multiple codes can co-exist.</p>
<p>Any values you put in your codes other than these tokens (such as punctuation
or other letters) will not be substituted and will be retained in generated
codes. For example, the format NNN:21:T will produce 001:21:D for the first dog
of the year.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Manually enter codes (do not generate): This option tells ASM that you don’t
want it to generate any codes. A code field will appear on the add animal
screen and apart from enforcing that codes are unique, ASM will do nothing
with the values entered by the user. Shortcodes can also be manually entered
unless the option to remove the box below is ticked.</p></li>
<li><p>Show short shelter codes on screens: This option tells ASM to display the
short code throughout the application instead of the main shelter code.</p></li>
<li><p>Remove short shelter code box from the animal details screen: Setting this
option will make ASM hide the short shelter code field at the top left of the
animal details screen. It does not stop ASM generating short codes behind the
scenes, it just stops them being visible on the screen.</p></li>
<li><p>Show codes on the shelter view screen: This option tells ASM to display the
code with the animal’s name on the shelter view screen and animal links on
the home page.</p></li>
<li><p>Once assigned, codes cannot be changed: Setting this option will make ASM
lock the shelter code fields, as well as the type and brought in date once an
animal record has been saved for the first time. This is to guarantee that
once an animal code has been handed out, it cannot be changed.</p></li>
<li><p>Allow duplicate microchip numbers: By default, the system will prevent you
entering or saving animals with a microchip number that has already been
allocated. In some situations this is desirable (for example, for figures
purposes some shelters prefer to create new animal records every time they
see an animal regardless of whether it has been through the shelter before).</p></li>
<li><p>Allow duplicate license numbers: By default, the system will prevent you
entering or saving licenses with a number that has already been used.
Some licensing regions use a tag number that stays with the animal for
life and need to allow duplicate licenses as a result.</p></li>
</ul>

<section id="boarding">
<h2>Boarding<a class="headerlink" href="#boarding" title="Permalink to this heading">¶</a></h2>

<section id="costs">
<h2>Costs<a class="headerlink" href="#costs" title="Permalink to this heading">¶</a></h2>
<p>The costs tab allows you to specify a default daily boarding cost for new
animals (this value can be modified on the animal’s cost tab).</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Create boarding cost record when animal is adopted: If set, then during
adoption the total daily boarding cost for the animal will be converted to a

<section id="data-protection">
<h2>Data Protection<a class="headerlink" href="#data-protection" title="Permalink to this heading">¶</a></h2>
<p>This tab allows configuration of how long ASM should keep certain types of data
before removing them. These settings can be used to enforce data retention
policies instigated as part of data protection compliance.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Anonymize personal data after this many years: If this option is on, the
system will automatically anonymize person records this many years after
their creation. Anonymizing will blank the name, email, address and telephone
fields. The city, state and zipcode (town, county and postcode for other locales)
will be retained along with the rest of the person data for statistics
and reporting. This option helps organisations in the EU to comply with
data retention policies and the GDPR by removing identifiable personal data.</p>
<p>To be anonymized, a record needs to be older than the retention period, and
all payments, clinic appointments, movements or log entries attached to the
person must be older than the retention period.  The person record cannot
have any flag that indicates an ongoing relationship with the shelter. These
flags are:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>aco, adoptioncoordinator, retailer, homechecker, member, shelter, foster, staff, vet, volunteer</p>
</div></blockquote>
</li>
</ul>
<div class="admonition warning">
<p class="admonition-title">Warning</p>
<p>Once anonymized, personal data is gone forever and cannot be recovered.</p>
</div>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Remove HTML and PDF document media after this many years: If this option is
on, the system will automatically delete HTML and PDF document media this
many years after its creation.</p></li>
</ul>
<div class="admonition warning">
<p class="admonition-title">Warning</p>
<p>Once deleted, documents are gone forever and cannot be recovered.</p>
</div>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Never anonymize people who adopted an animal: If this option is set, people
with the adopter flag are included in the list of people who won’t be
anonymized.</p></li>
<li><p>Show GDPR Contact Opt-In field on person screens: If this option is on, the
system will show a contact opt-in field on person records. You can use it to
specify which forms of communication a person prefers. When saving the
record, if “Email” is not in the list of preferred communication methods, the
“Exclude from bulk email” flag will automatically be set on the person’s
record.</p></li>
<li><p>When I set a new GDPR Opt-In contact option, make a note of it in the log
with this type: This option will automatically log any changes to the contact
opt-in field so that the person who changed it along with the date and time
are recorded in the log.</p></li>
</ul>

<section id="defaults">
<h2>Defaults<a class="headerlink" href="#defaults" title="Permalink to this heading">¶</a></h2>
<p>This screen allows configuration of the system defaults. These defaults are
used to select starting values when finding and creating animals and other
records.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Mark new animals as not for adoption: Setting this option will cause ASM to
automatically tick the “not for adoption” box when creating new animals. This
is an extra precaution - by forcing users to untick the box when necessary,
no animal can be accidentally published.</p></li>
<li><p>Exclude new animal photos from publishing: Setting this option will make
any photos uploaded to the media tab not sent by the publishers or included
in any websites. If an animal does not have any other photos, they will
continue to have the “No photo available” picture until the picture is
made available for publishing (by ticking the red cross to the lower right
of it on the media tab). This allows new photos to be vetted before
being sent to adoption sites or used anywhere.</p></li>
<li><p>Prefill new media notes for animal images with animal comments if left blank:
If no notes are given when adding images as media, ASM will default the
animal’s comments field.</p></li>
<li><p>Prefill new media notes with the filename if left blank: If the media being
added is not an image and the notes are blank, use the original filename as
the notes.</p></li>
<li><p>When I change the flags on an animal/person, make a note of it in the log
with this type:  If this option is on a log record is created when you add
or remove a person or animal flag.</p></li>
<li><p>When I mark an animal held, make a note of it in the log: If this option is on,
a log record is created when you mark an animal held along with the hold
until date.</p></li>
<li><p>When I change the location of an animal, make a note of it in the log: If
this option is on, a log record is created every time you change an animal’s
internal location with the new location so you can track the history of where
the animal has moved within your shelter.</p></li>
<li><p>When I change the weight of an animal, make a note of it in the log: If
this option is on, a log record is created every time you change an animal’s
weight so you can track the history of an animal’s wieght with reports and
graphs.</p></li>

this option is enabled, diary notes linked to animals are completed when the
animal is given a deceased date.</p></li>
<li><p>Email users their outstanding diary notes once per day: This option will cause
the system to send users an email containing their outstanding diary notes.

<li><p>Use Fancy Tooltips: If your browser supports it (all but IE8), ASM can use
modern callout style tooltips in the interface.</p></li>
<li><p>Use HTML5 client side image scaling: If your browser supports it, media will
be scaled on your PC before being uploaded to the server to save time.</p></li>
<li><p>Show animal thumbnails in movement and medical books: Show animal pictures in
the rows of the movement and medical books (foster book, reservation book,
vaccination book, etc.)</p></li>
<li><p>Show pink and blue borders around animal thumbnails to indicate sex: Makes
the border around thumbnails pink for girls and blue for boy animals.</p></li>
<li><p>Show a minimap of the address on person screens: Show an embedded map next to the
person’s address on the details screen. Also shows a minimap on the dispatch
slider of incidents.</p></li>
<li><p>When entering addresses, restrict states to valid US 2 letter state codes:
When this option is on, the state field will switch to a dropdown that only
allows valid US states to be selected. The default state for screens will be
auto selected from the state chosen on the shelter details options tab.</p></li>
<li><p>Allow editing of latitude/longitude with minimaps: Allow the latitude/longitude
geocodes to be hand edited in fields near the minimap and address. Right clicking
on the minimap will add a new pin and update the fields.</p></li>
<li><p>Default to table mode when viewing media tabs: When accessing the media tab
of records, show the media records in a sortable table with metadata
information. You can toggle the view mode of media tabs with the button on
the right side of the toolbar.</p></li>
<li><p>Show weights as lb and oz: Enter and show weights with separate pounds and
ounces. eg: 5 lbs and 6 oz</p></li>

If neither this or the previous show weights option is set, weights are shown
in kg, eg: 20.1 kg</p></li>
<li><p>Show complete comments in table views: When viewing comments or log notes in
tables, show the complete text instead of truncating it to 80 characters and
fitting the text onto one line.</p></li>
<li><p>Show record views in the audit trail: When viewing the audit trail slider of
a record, include audit records that show when users viewed this record.</p></li>
<li><p>Show ID numbers when editing lookup data: When browsing lookup data under
<span class="menuselection">Settings ‣ Lookup Data</span>, show the internal system ID numbers.
This is handy for looking up IDs when writing reports.</p></li>
<li><p>Keep table headers visible when scrolling: If selected, when scrolling down
long tables their headers will float at the top of the screen to remind you
of the column headings.</p></li>
<li><p>Open records in a new browser tab: Open all records in their own browser

restricted to only viewing animals in set internal locations. With this
option enabled, a location filter field will appear on the system users
screen allowing you to set the locations a user account is restricted to
viewing.</p></li>
<li><p>Enable multiple sites: Once enabled, sites can be created in the lookup data
section. Sites can be assigned to locations, user accounts, incidents  and
people records. User accounts with a particular site assigned can only see
animals in locations belonging to their site, along with people and incidents
at their site. Leaving a person, location or incident with no site allows
anyone to see it. Leaving a user account without a site allows it to see all
sites.  This allows you to handle multiple sites with one ASM database. A
number of site-specific reports are available in the repository.</p></li>
<li><p>Format telephone numbers according to my locale: When leaving fields containing
phone numbers, if the numeric portion is the correct length, format them
according to your locale. Eg: US numbers become (XXX) XXX-XXXX</p></li>
<li><p>When displaying person names in lists, use the format: In movement books,
donation books, the waiting list, etc. when showing person names, ASM can use
different formats if you want surname first for sorting, etc.</p></li>
<li><p>When displaying calendars, the first day of the week is: For date choosers
and calendar view, select which day the week should start on. For the US
and some Jewish cultures, it’s generally Sunday, for the rest of the world,
Monday.</p></li>

<section id="documents">
<h2>Documents<a class="headerlink" href="#documents" title="Permalink to this heading">¶</a></h2>
<p>The documents tab allows you to change various settings related to generating
documents from templates.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Allow use of OpenOffice document templates: Browser based applications cannot
support native applications like OpenOffice as well as the browser-based word
processor built into ASM, however with this option on you can continue to use
OpenOffice templates. With this option enabled, the document template screen
will also allow you to upload OpenOffice documents as templates. When
generating a document from an OpenOffice template, ASM will substitute the
correct tags in the OpenOffice template and send the constructed document to
the web browser as a binary file with the correct mime type for display in
OpenOffice or download.</p></li>
<li><p>Printing word processor docuemnts uses hidden iframe and window.print:By
default when printing documents in the built-in wordprocessor, an iframe is
used to display and print only the document. This works fine for desktop web
browsers, but if you use mobile devices where the print command sends the URL
to a separate printing service, this will not work and you should untick this
option. Unticking this option will cause the print button to redirect to a
separate copy of the document by itself for use by mobile printing services.</p></li>
<li><p>Send PDF files inline instead of as attachments: If this option is on, ASM
will tell the browser to show PDF documents in the main page. Otherwise, it
will send them as attachments for you to download.</p></li>
<li><p>Include incomplete medical records when generating document templates: If
set, vaccinations, tests and medical regimens will be included that are incomplete
when accessing them via LastX, Due and Recent wordkeys.</p></li>
<li><p>When I generate a document, make a note of it in the log: If this option is
on, a log record is created every time you generate a document.</p></li>
<li><p>Default zoom level when converting documents to PDF: This setting controls how
the text is scaled when converting a document to PDF. Older versions of the
PDF converter used by SM would to scale to the widest element on the page,
however newer versions do not do this. To get back the behaviour that older
versions of SM had with wkhtmltopdf &lt;= 0.12.3, set this value to 130.</p></li>

<li><p>Pre-create all treatments when creating fixed-length medical regimens:
Enabling this option will have creation of a new medical regimen create all
of its treatments up-front. If the new regimen has a “Completed” status, all
the treatments will be marked as given. This can be useful when entering
historic records.  The default behaviour without this option is to create
treatments incrementally as each previous treatment is given. This is done to
prevent staff accidentally overdosing animals or having to “catch up” when a
treatment is missed.</p></li>
<li><p>Reload the medical book/tab automatically after adding new medical items: If
selected, reloads the screen automatically after adding a new medical
regimen. If this option is not enabled, a placeholder row will be shown for
the new medical item instead and the status column will show a link to reload
the screen. This option is useful if you have a full medical book or animals
with a lot of medical items who are frequently treated and reload times are

<p>In order for ASM to receive notification that payments have been received, a
Webhook needs to be created in the Stripe dashboard to receive
“checkout.session.completed” events under <span class="menuselection">Developers ‣
Webhooks</span></p>
<p>The Payment Processors option tab in ASM will display the URL you need to
configure for your webhook below the key fields.</p>

<h3>System<a class="headerlink" href="#system" title="Permalink to this heading">¶</a></h3>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Remove boarding functionality from screens and menus: If your shelter does
not board animals for the public, this option will disable the system’s boarding
functionality from the financial menu and animal/person screens.</p></li>
<li><p>Remove clinic functionality from screens and menus: If your shelter does
not run a clinic, this option will disable the system’s clinic appointment
and invoicing functionality from the medical menu and animal/person screens.</p></li>
<li><p>Remove move menu and the movements tab from animal and person screens: If
your shelter does not do adoptions and animals never leave, this option will
disable the system’s movement functionality.</p></li>
<li><p>Remove retailer functionality from the movement screens and menus: Setting
this option removes the retailer fields from the movement screens and
retailer specific options from the menu.</p></li>
<li><p>Remove the document repository functionality from menus: Setting this option
removes the central document repository from the menu.</p></li>
<li><p>Remove the online form functionality from menus: Setting this option removes
the online form screens from the menu.</p></li>
<li><p>Remove the animal control functionality from menus: Setting this option
removes the animal control screens from the menu.</p></li>
<li><p>Remove fine-grained animal control incident permissions: Setting this option
removes the “View Roles” control from the new incident and edit incident
screens. The “View Roles” control allows a user to specify exactly which
users can see the incident.</p></li>
<li><p>Remove the rota functionality from menus: Setting this option removes
the staff rota from the menu and person screens.</p></li>
<li><p>Remove the stock control functionality from menus: Setting this option

</section>
<section id="people">
<h3>People<a class="headerlink" href="#people" title="Permalink to this heading">¶</a></h3>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Remove the city/state fields from person details: Setting this option will
prevent ASM from presenting the user with additional fields to store the city
and state information. These are handy for group owner searches, but not all
shelters want or need them and prefer to keep the complete address in the
address box.</p></li>
<li><p>Remove the country field from person details: Setting this option will
hide the country field from person addresses. This option is on by default
since most shelters only deal with one country.</p></li>
<li><p>Remove the homechecked/by fields from person type according to the homechecked
flag: This option is on by default and will hide the homechecked by and date
fields from the person type slider if they don’t have the homechecked flag.
This option exists because some users prefer to assign the person doing the
homecheck before the flag to confirm the person is homechecked.</p></li>
<li><p>Remove the insurance number field from the movement screens: Setting this
option hides the insurance number field and button from <span class="menuselection">Move
‣ Adopt an animal</span> and all movement tabs/books.</p></li>
</ul>

<section id="animals">
<h3>Animals<a class="headerlink" href="#animals" title="Permalink to this heading">¶</a></h3>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Remove the asilomar fields from the entry/deceased section: (US locales only)
This option hides the asimilor intake and death category fields from the
Entry and Deceased sliders.</p></li>
<li><p>Remove the coat type field from the animal screen: If ticked, ASM won’t
display the coat type dropdown on the animal editing screen. For some
shelters, keeping coat types is unnecessary (particularly for those that keep
reptiles and birds!), so you can disable it here.</p></li>
<li><p>Remove the microchip fields from the animal screen: If ticked, ASM won’t
display the microchip indicator, number and date fields. For shelters that
don’t keep microchipped animals (eg: Reptiles and birds).</p></li>
<li><p>Remove the tattoo fields from the animal screen: If ticked, ASM won’t display
the tattoo indicator, number and date fields. Useful for shelters that don’t
keep animals with ear tattoos.</p></li>
<li><p>Remove the spay/neutered fields from the animal screen: If ticked, ASM won’t
display the neutered/spayed flag and date. Useful for shelters that keep
animals that do not require neutering (small mammals, birds, reptiles,
horses, etc).</p></li>
<li><p>Remove the declawed field from the animal screen: If ticked, ASM won’t
display the declawed flag. Useful for shelters that don’t keep cats, or for
countries where declawing is illegal (such as the UK).</p></li>
<li><p>Remove the heartworm test fields from the animal screen: If ticked, ASM won’t
display the heartworm test fields. Useful for shelters with animals that do
not require heartworm tests.</p></li>
<li><p>Remove the FIV/L test fields from the animal screen: If ticked, ASM won’t
display the Combi test or FIV/FLV test fields (depending on your locale).</p></li>
<li><p>Remove the “Good With…” and Housetrained fields from the animal screen: If
ticked, ASM won’t display the good with cats/dogs/children and housetrained
fields. Useful for shelters that don’t keep cats and dogs.</p></li>
<li><p>Remove the adoption fee field from the animal screen: If ticked, ASM won’t
show the adoption fee field on the animal details. If this option is not on
and an animal has a fee set, it will override the donation amount in the
<span class="menuselection">Move ‣ Adopt an animal</span> and <span class="menuselection">Move ‣
Reserve an animal</span> screens.</p></li>
<li><p>Remove the adoption coordinator field from the animal entry screeen: If ticked,
ASM won’t show the adoption coordinator field on the entry slider. Adoption
coordinators are generally used by smaller, distributed rescues.</p></li>
<li><p>Remove the Litter ID/Acceptance Number field from the animal screen: If
ticked, ASM won’t display the Litter ID or Acceptance Number field at the top
of the details screen. If your shelter does not track litters, or is not a UK
RSPCA shelter, you can turn this off and save some space on the screen.</p></li>
<li><p>Remove the location unit field from animal details: If ticked, ASM won’t
display the location unit field (this is the cage or pen number if your
shelter uses those).</p></li>
<li><p>Remove the Bonded With fields from the entry details screen: If ticked, ASM
won’t display the fields that allow an animal to be marked as bonded with
other animals (bonding is particularly common with rescues that deal with
rabbits and is the recommendation that pairs of animals are adopted
together).</p></li>
<li><p>Remove the picked up fields from the entry details screen: If ticked, ASM
won’t display the fields that allow an animal to be marked as picked up in a
particular location or by an ACO (useful for shelters who do not have staff
picking up animals).</p></li>

<h2>Reports<a class="headerlink" href="#reports" title="Permalink to this heading">¶</a></h2>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Email scheduled reports with no data: If you have set reports to be
automatically emailed at a time of day, empty reports with “No data to show”
will be emailed if this box is ticked.</p></li>
<li><p>Show report menu items in collapsed categories: If you have a lot of reports
installed, this option allows you to just show the categories in the reports
menu. Clicking a category expands it.</p></li>

<h2>Shelter View<a class="headerlink" href="#shelter-view" title="Permalink to this heading">¶</a></h2>
<p>The shelter view tab allows the default grouping to be set.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Allow drag and drop to move animals between locations: If set, you can drag animal
thumbnails between locations in shelter view to move them.</p></li>
<li><p>Show empty locations: If set, headings for all internal locations will be shown,
even if there are no animals in them.</p></li>

<section id="waiting-list">
<h2>Waiting List<a class="headerlink" href="#waiting-list" title="Permalink to this heading">¶</a></h2>
<p>The waiting list tab allows an update period to be configured here. Simply
specify in days the interval between updates (how often a waiting list entry is
bumped up the urgency ratings until it reaches “High”). Another option is
available to select the default waiting list urgency - this is the default
start value given to new waiting list entries. You can also choose hold
separate rankings for species on the waiting list. This makes sense if your
shelter takes dogs and cats for example and whether you can take a cat is
independent of how many dogs are on the shelter.</p>
</section>
<section id="watermark">
<h2>Watermark<a class="headerlink" href="#watermark" title="Permalink to this heading">¶</a></h2>
<p>Watermarking is a feature available under the media tab of animal records. It
allows you to embed a logo and the animal’s name within a photo.</p>
<p>By default, the watermark image is added to the bottom right corner of the
photo and the name in the bottom left.</p>
<p>Note that the original image will be changed, so you will need to upload the
same image twice if you want to retain a copy without the watermark.</p>
<p>The options on this tab allow you to control the placement of the watermark
image and animal name, along with the colours used for the text of the name.</p>
<p>For this feature to be available, you need to upload your watermark image,
named “watermark.png” to <span class="menuselection">Settings ‣ Reports ‣ Extra Images</span>
- note that the image must be a PNG file, so that an alpha channel for
transparency can be included.</p>
