<h1>Publishing<a class="headerlink" href="#publishing" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p>ASM can update many third party adoption sites and microchip registries as well
as generating websites of your adoptable and recently adopted animals. The
sites produced are based on simple editable templates and can be completely
customised and branded to suit you.</p>
<p>All of this functionality is accessed via the top level Publishing menu.</p>
<p>There are many options you can set to choose what appears on the output, and
how the output is generated. Set these options under <span class="menuselection">Publishing
‣ Set Publishing Options</span></p>
<div class="section" id="animal-selection">
<h2>Animal Selection<a class="headerlink" href="#animal-selection" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<img alt="_images/animal_selection.png" src="_images/animal_selection.png" />
<p>The Animal Selection tab allows you to control which animals are considered
adoptable by ASM’s internet publishers.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Include [category] animals: Select “yes” to include animals fitting the
category.</p></li>
<li><p>Merge bonded animals into a single record: When outputting bonded animals,
merge them into a single entry. The names will be joined together with
commas, but other than that all the details will be of the first animal in
the sort so make sure the bio/notes include information on the bonded animals
for all of them.</p></li>
<li><p>Exclude animals aged under: This box is to prevent puppies and kittens who
are too young being included in the list of available adoptions. You may
choose an age limit on animals that appear. By default, the system excludes
animals less than 1 year old (52 weeks).</p></li>
<li><p>Include animals in the following locations: Select the locations to include
adoptable animals from. If none are selected, all locations will be used.</p></li>
</ul>
<div class="admonition note">
<p class="admonition-title">Note</p>
<p>In addition to items you select here, any animal which has the “Courtesy Listing” flag will be automatically included.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="all-publishers">
<h2>All Publishers<a class="headerlink" href="#all-publishers" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<img alt="_images/all_publishers.png" src="_images/all_publishers.png" />
<p>The All Publishers tab allows you to set options common to all internet publishers.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Register microchips after: If you are registering microchips, ASM will update
the owner information with the registry after these types of movements.
Non-shelter animals will always be registered with their original owner
information if present, using the microchip date as a trigger.
A special “Intake” option allows registering of microchips to the shelter’s
contact info for animals currently in the care of the shelter. This includes
animals brought to the shelter as well as those returned from a previous movement.
Animals who are marked as held awaiting reclaim will <em>not</em> be registered until
after the hold is removed.</p></li>
<li><p>Register microchips from: When registering microchips, only consider animals
where the event triggering registration (intake, adoption, reclaim, etc)
occurred after this date. This is useful when enabling registration for the
first time on a database full of a historic data where you do not want to
re-register old chips to potentially out of date adopters.</p></li>
<li><p>Update adoption websites every: Some adoption websites will accept updates
more frequently than the 24 hour default. Setting this option to a value
smaller than 24 will update those services at the chosen interval. Services
affected by this value are PetFinder, AdoptAPet, PetRescue, SavourLife and
Maddie’s Pet Assistant</p></li>
<li><p>Reupload animal images every time: Ticking this box will tell the publisher
to reupload images for all the animals published. Normally, ASM will not
upload an image it has previously uploaded to save bandwidth. ASM will detect
the preferred image changing and force a reupload for that animal without
the need for this option. This option will be ignored by some publishers
(notably RescueGroups.org and AdoptAPet.com) as reuploading all images constantly
is considered abusive behaviour.</p></li>
<li><p>Upload all available images for animals: Ticking this box will have the
publisher upload all the images for each animal where available. They will be
named sheltercode-X.jpg (X increments for each image). The first image will
be the image flagged as web preferred.</p></li>
<li><p>Order published animals by: Sorts the list of animals before they are
published.</p></li>
<li><p>Thumbnail size: Controls the size of thumbnails the system generates for adoptable
animal publishers (in particular the ones used by the javascript include
method of website integration). The size is for the thumbnail’s longest side.</p></li>
<li><p>Animal descriptions: This determines the source of the main description for
animals when being published. For the HTML/FTP publisher, this is the source
of the $$WebMediaNotes$$ token. Set to “Use animal comments” to use the
comments field from the notes section of the animal’s record. “Use notes from
preferred photo” will use the notes field on the animal’s web preferred
photo.</p></li>
<li><p>Add this text to all animal descriptions: Allows you to set a footer on every
animal description before it is published. Note that this does not apply
to courtesy listings, allowing you to add additional contact info.</p></li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section" id="html-ftp-publishing">
<span id="htmlftppublisher"></span><h2>HTML/FTP Publishing<a class="headerlink" href="#html-ftp-publishing" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>ASM can create websites for you using a simple templating system and optionally
upload them to an FTP server. The pages themselves can be split down by species
and age, or arranged numerically with a fixed number of animals per page. In
addition, a recently adopted page can be generated along with an rss.xml for
feed readers.</p>
<div class="admonition warning">
<p class="admonition-title">Warning</p>
<p>Static HTML publishing is deprecated for sheltermanager.com and is no longer available.</p>
</div>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Generate javascript database: The site search facilities require a Javascript
database, indexing the available animal records. If you wish to include
search facilities, make sure this box is ticked.</p></li>
<li><p>Generate thumbnail images: The publisher will create thumbnails of all the
animal images. Thumbnail images have the same name as the animal image, but
are prefixed with tn and an underscore. You can use tn_$$WebMediaFilename$$
in a template to get the thumbnail image for the current animal.</p></li>
<li><p>Thumbnail size: The desired length in pixels of the longest side of the
generated thumbnail.</p></li>
<li><p>Output a separate page for each animal type: Output extra pages of the form
ANIMALTYPE.EXTENSION, eg: Miscellaneous.html. This means you can reference
the page of miscellaneous animals only from your website. If you have used
any punctuation or spaces in the animal type, then they will be turned into
to underscores. For example, a type of “D (Dog)” will create a page called
D__Dog_.html</p></li>
<li><p>Output a separate page for each species: Output extra pages of the form
SPECIES.EXTENSION, eg: Dog.html. This means you can reference the page of
adoptable dogs only from your website.</p></li>
<li><p>Split species pages with a baby/adult prefix: If this option is selected, ASM
will output species pages in the form baby/adultSPECIES.EXTENSION. Eg:
babyCat.html and adultCat.html for cats/kittens. This option only works in
conjunction with the “Output a separate page for each species” option.</p></li>
<li><p>Split baby/adult age at: The split point to determine juvenile animals.</p></li>
<li><p>Output an adopted animals page: If set to yes, a file named adopted.EXTENSION
will be output that you can use to reference recently adopted animals.</p></li>
<li><p>Output a deceased animals page: If set to yes, a file named deceased.EXTENSION
will be output that you can use to reference recently deceased animals
as a tribute page.</p></li>
<li><p>Output a page with links to available online forms: If set to yes, a file
named forms.EXTENSION will be output that contains a link to all the online
forms in the database.</p></li>
<li><p>Output an rss.xml page: If set to yes, a file named rss.xml will be output
for feed readers. It will use the rss template if it is available in your
database, if it’s not then it will be constructed from a default template
built into the program.</p></li>
<li><p>Show animals adopted: If outputting an adopted animals page is on, how far
back the adoptions should be included.</p></li>
<li><p>Page extension: The file EXTENSION to give a page. Eg: html</p></li>
<li><p>Publishing template: The template ASM should use to construct the
header/footer/body elements of the pages. ASM comes with a set of included
templates, outlined in the next section.</p></li>
<li><p>Animals per page: ASM will always output numbered pages of the form
1.EXTENSION, 2.EXTENSION, etc. Specify here how many animals you’d like
before moving on to the next page. By default, the system shows 10 animals
per page, however the more animals you put on a page, the longer the page
will take to load.</p></li>
<li><p>Scale published images to: This box allows you to reduce the size of your
animal images to a particular resolution.  ASM scales down pictures when you
attach them under the media tab, so unless you want to make them smaller
still, it’s best to leave this at No Scaling.</p></li>
<li><p>Publish to folder: Choose the folder where output is to be generated.</p></li>
</ul>
<div class="admonition warning">
<p class="admonition-title">Warning</p>
<p>This folder is on the machine that ASM is installed on, not your local client PC. If this is left blank, a temporary folder will be used.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="included-templates">
<h3>Included templates<a class="headerlink" href="#included-templates" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>ASM comes with a number of site templates – plain, rss, littlebox and sm.com.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>plain produces very simple HTML output - just the animal’s picture and a few
details in a list.</p></li>
<li><p>rss produces XML output for interpreting by an RSS feed reader.</p></li>
<li><p>sm.com uses CSS hover elements and javascript to do image substitution for
icons and other tricks.</p></li>
<li><p>littlebox is also more advanced, using CSS overlays and popups.</p></li>
<li><p>responsive uses relative sizings to work equally well on mobile devices. It
is not dissimilar to plain, but also features the ability to click an
animal’s photo for more information.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>You can edit these templates under <span class="menuselection">Publishing ‣ Edit HTML
Publishing Templates</span> and add your own new ones if desired. Templates are made
up of three sections.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>The header block - this is output for each page before any animal records.</p></li>
<li><p>The footer block - this is output for each page after all the animal records.</p></li>
<li><p>The body block - this is output for each animal record and has keys to pull
data from the database and the animal’s image(s). The keys available are
those available for animal documents (see wordkeys in the appendix at the end
of this document) and are enclosed in $$ - eg: $$ShelterCode$$ will output
the animal’s shelter code.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>A number of special keys are allowed in the header and footer blocks that pull
information from other areas of the system. These are:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>$$ORGNAME$$ - Becomes your organisation’s name</p></li>
<li><p>$$ORGADDRESS$$ - Your organisation’s address</p></li>
<li><p>$$ORGTEL$$ - Your organisation’s telephone number (all of these org fields
can be found under <span class="menuselection">System ‣ Options</span>)</p></li>
<li><p>$$ORGEMAIL$$ - Your email address (this is taken from
<span class="menuselection">Settings ‣ Options ‣ Email</span>)</p></li>
<li><p>$$USER$$ - Substitutes the current system user, including their real name</p></li>
<li><p>$$DATE$$ - The current date</p></li>
<li><p>$$TIME$$ - The current time</p></li>
<li><p>$$DATETIME$$ - The current date and time</p></li>
<li><p>$$VERSION$$ - The ASM version</p></li>
<li><p>$$NAV$$ - If you are using numbered pages, outputs navigation with the
current page disabled and links to the other available pages. Returns
a blank for recently adopted animal pages.</p></li>
<li><p>$$TITLE$$ - An appropriate title based on the page being published. If
it is a recently adopted page, the title will be “Recently adopted” in
your language. Otherwise, it will be “Available for adoption”.</p></li>
<li><p>$$TOTAL$$ - The number of animals output by the publisher</p></li>
</ul>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="adoptapet-com">
<h2>adoptapet.com<a class="headerlink" href="#adoptapet-com" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>ASM can send data to 1-800-Save-A-Pet.com (now known as AdoptAPet.com) and
upload your animals for adoption directly to your account with them.</p>
<p>You will need to go to the publishing options first and enter the user name
given to you by AdoptAPet.com and your password. All you need to do then is
choose Publish to AdoptAPet.com. The options for filtering animals are the same
(see previous section for reference).</p>
<p>If you have mapped the colours and wish to include them, you will need to tick
the “Include colors in column 9” checkbox on the AdoptAPet panel of the
publishing options.</p>
<p>You can also have ASM stop sending the import.cfg file after the first export.
This means you can then grab it from their FTP server and edit it yourself if
you wish to change any mappings, then put it back again. This is generally only
necessary for users who want to send colour information.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="helpinglostpets-com">
<h2>helpinglostpets.com<a class="headerlink" href="#helpinglostpets-com" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>ASM can send data to www.helpinglostpets.com, a map-based website that
publishes adoptable and found animals. Your ASM found data will also be
published as well as adoptable animals. You will need an organisation ID, FTP
username and password and to enter the postal/zipcode of your shelter.</p>
<p>Helpinglostpets.com is global and can accept data from shelters in any country.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="maddiesfund-org-maddie-s-pet-assistant">
<h2>maddiesfund.org / Maddie’s Pet Assistant<a class="headerlink" href="#maddiesfund-org-maddie-s-pet-assistant" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>ASM can send data to Maddie’s Fund/MPA - an application to provide information
and interactive help to fosterers, adopters and other caregivers. Basic data on
the animal and contact information for the adopter/fosterer is sent.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="petfinder-com">
<h2>petfinder.com<a class="headerlink" href="#petfinder-com" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>In addition to creating standalone websites with animals up for adoption, ASM
can also integrate with PetFinder.com and upload your animals for adoption
directly to your account with them.  You will need to go to
<span class="menuselection">Publishing ‣ Set Publishing Options</span> first and view the
PetFinder panel. Here, you should enter the shelter Id given to you by
PetFinder.com and the FTP password they have assigned to you.</p>
<p>You can also opt to have your shelter animals with the “Hold” flag sent with
the PetFinder H status, and shelter animals who have the word “Stray” in
their entry category sent with an F status. This will put those animals into
PetFinder’s lost and found database to help with reuniting stray pets with
their owners.</p>
<div class="admonition note">
<p class="admonition-title">Note</p>
<p>If you have created new Species or Breeds within ASM, you will need to map them to the available publisher options under the Breed and Species sections of <span class="menuselection">Settings ‣ Lookup Data</span></p>
</div>
<p>If you have some that are not mapped, the publisher will fail with an error
message.</p>
<p>PetFinder has some quirks in that they indicate an unknown crossbreed by having
a blank secondary breed with the crossbreed flag set. Since ASM doesn’t allow
you to set an empty second breed field, there’s a workaround - If you make the
second breed the same as the first breed with the crossbreed flag set, ASM will
send that second breed as a blank to PetFinder. This behaviour can also be
triggered by setting your second breed to “Crossbreed”, “Unknown” or “Mix”.</p>

<li><p>pfprimarycolor, pfsecondarycolor, pftertiarycolor (Text): ASM only uses a
single value for animal color, so our color field cannot be mapped to PetFinder.
Instead, you can add the three color fields that PetFinder used and supply
appropriate values. The values they will accept for color depend on the species
of your animal and can be found here: <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/bobintetley/asm3/files/3487421/import.breeds.coats.colors.updated.Aug.2019.xlsx">https://github.com/bobintetley/asm3/files/3487421/import.breeds.coats.colors.updated.Aug.2019.xlsx</a></p></li>

<p>It is possible to exclude an animal from a specific publisher. To do this,
create a new animal flag called “Exclude from PUBLISHER”, where PUBLISHER is
the name of the service you wish to exclude. Eg: “Exclude from PetFinder”.</p>
<p>Assigning this animal flag to your animal will then prevent it being sent by
that publisher. You can create flags for all the 3rd party publishers you use
and assign them in combination where necessary.</p>
<p>The flag names are not case sensitive. The names should not include any domains,
eg: petfinder, adoptapet, rescuegroups, maddiesfund, petrescue, savourlife</p>
<p>This is useful in situations where you get inundanted with applications for
very popular animals and only want to put them on your own website.</p>
