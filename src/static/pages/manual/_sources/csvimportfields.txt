Appendix: CSV file import fields
================================

ASM will recognise columns with the following names when importing CSV files. Where you wish to supply multiple rows for the same animal (such as for vaccinations or regimens), make sure you have a populated ANIMALCODE column, similarly for multiple rows to people (such as movements, licenses, etc) make sure you have populated person data.
