Vaccination Keys
----------------

Vaccination keys let you access the vaccination records for an animal. There
are multiple ways of accessing the records. You construct a key that contains
the field name and then an index for it. The field names are:

VaccinationName
    The name of the vaccination (eg: Booster) 
VaccinationRequired
    The date the vaccination is required 
VaccinationGiven
    The date the vaccination was given 
VaccinationExpires
    The date the vaccination expires if known
VaccinationBatch
    The batch number from the vaccination adminstered
VaccinationManufacturer
    The manufacturer of the vaccine
VaccinationRabiesTag
    The rabies tag number accompanying this vaccine
VaccinationCost
    The cost of this vaccine
VaccinationComments
    The vaccination comments
VaccinationDescription
    The vaccination description from the lookup data.
VaccinationAdministeringVetName
    The name of the vet who administered the vaccination
VaccinationAdministeringVetLicence / VaccinationAdministeringVetLicense
    The licence number of the vet who administered the vaccination
VaccinationAdministeringVetAddress
    The address of the vet who administered the vaccination
VaccinationAdministeringVetTown / VaccinationAdministeringVetCity
    The town/city of the vet who administered the vaccination
VaccinationAdministeringVetCounty / VaccinationAdministeringVetState
    The county/state of the vet who administered the vaccination
VaccinationAdministeringVetPostcode / VaccinationAdministeringVetZipcode
    The postal/zip code of the vet who administered the vaccination
VaccinationAdministeringVetEmail
    The email address of the vet who administered the vaccination

Just putting a number on the end of the fieldname returns that field for the
records, counting from oldest to newest. For example, VaccinationName1 returns
the name of the first vaccination on file for the animal.

You can use the suffix Lastn, where n is a number to count from the newest to
the oldest instead. For example, VaccinationGivenLast1 returns the given date
of the most recent vaccination record.

You can also use the vaccination type itself as an index, for example
VaccinationRequiredDHCPP will return the latest vaccination record of type
DHCPP. If your vaccination type has spaces in its name, then remove them when
constructing the key. Eg: A type of “DHCPP Vacc” would bcome
<<VaccinationRequiredDHCPPVacc>> when accessing it via a wordkey.

The “Recent” keyword operates with the vaccination type and allows you to
select the most recent vaccination of that type that has a non-blank given
date. Eg: VaccinationCommentsRecentDHCPP will return the comments of the last
given DHCPP vaccination.

The "Due" keyword operates with the vaccination type and allows you to
select the most recent vaccination of that type that has a blank given given 
date. Eg: VaccinationRequiredDueDHCPP will return the date the most recent
due DHCPP vaccination. Note that the "Due" keyword will not work if you have 
turned off the option to include incomplete medical items from documents under
:menuselection:`Settings --> Options --> Documents --> Include incomplete medical records when generating document templates`
